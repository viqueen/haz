I like to write things from scratch, not to reinvent the wheel but to understand why it rolls

This repo is more of a playground for me, it does not quite serve any purpose but my own entertainment
For instance I once wanted to write a java decompiler, I did ... then I wanted to write an Audio Signal Processor ... I did
but then I was like "hmm parsing through a byte stream hmm"
So I wrote a byte stream codec ... for that I needed to evaluate some arithmetic expressions, you know because of this and that ...
So I wrote an expression evaluator ...

You can imagine it goes on forever

Well I recently finally got to that old university folder called "ToLookIntoAfterGraduation"
it has only been 4 years now ...

So I am having a lot of "what the hell was I thinking writing this line", rewriting some of it as I see fit


PS: I also go out to meet people for entertainment too
